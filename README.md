Manage everything about your projects in one app

Developed by Michael Spencer

### Setting up and Running ###

Project Dashboard requires a repository of mine called Ubuntu UI Extras, which must be available in the root directory of the repository. You can either clone it from the project's root directory or if you have my very helpful [devutils](http://github.com/iBeliever/devutils) project in your `$PATH `, you can simply run:

    code use ubuntu-ui-extras
    
I do continue to improve the `ubuntu-ui-extras` repository, so make sure you update it, either by using `git pull` if you manually cloned it, or if you used `devutils`, you can run:

    code update ubuntu-ui-extras
